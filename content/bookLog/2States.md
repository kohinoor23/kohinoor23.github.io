### Act 1: Ahmedabad  
(_03/12/23_) Starts off with the first meet between Krish and Ananya . Ananya  is the college crush, and brimming with confidence. Krish turns a chance encounter into a restaurant lunch, by a sacrifice of a rasgulla. A weekly cycle broken for the sake of a lifelong commitment. Well done! At lunch, they dive deeper into lives, knowing about 11 martyrs before Ka. Krish is undettered, and they move closer via Microeconomics, Krish showcasing his math prowess. Silent study sessions slowly turn to acts of restraint for Ka, and it all comes together a few days after they fetch a B+ and A-. Now, the author happily fast forwards 1.5 years to placement season, where the question of "what next" comes up. Quite cinematic of how Krish interrupts Ananya 's interview to tell his final decision of "what next". In the end, all turns out well between them, and comes the next challenge: family. The first encounters are anticlimatic, and the act is curtained. Some key takeaways: Loved how Krish utilised his geeky math prowess to keep the connection, and used the "ignore strategy" to remind Ananya  of his importance. Also, he knew of the right time to report his uneasiness. 

## Act 2: Delhi
(_04/12/23_) Scene at Krish's Delhi home. He is yet to join Citibank, and is fully-free. The decision of choosing his first work location haunts him. A small fight with his mother and his father's attitude towards family convinces him to keep Delhi as a top choice. Ananya's memories help Chennai to battle Delhi for the top spot. An interesting detour is taken when Krish's mother takes him to see Dolly, a rich Punjabi girl. Turns out she knows about Krish and Ananya from family connections, and is still interested in Krish. Dolly is mocked by the author for her maturity in relationships. Krish has a straight 'no', and smartly uses his "writing ambition" to seal the deal. Some heated discussions with the post-military father are covered. In the end, Krish fills both Delhi and Chennai at top. As it turns out, God assigns him to Chennai. Some key takeaways: Secrets about personal life zoom through family, beware; even God supports true love.

## Act 3: Chennai
(_06/12/23_) Lets dive into the main act. Chennai covers more than half of the novel. On that note, prayers for Chennai people, read about floods in Chennai due to cyclone recently. Coming to the story, Krish arrives to Chennai, and struggles to communicate. Nungabakkam, which is 100 rupees away, demands 500 rupees through the auto-driver. Well, greed is a common human sentiment. Accompanied by a Tamil-settled sardaar, Krish saves 400 rupees. Without surprise, he is the only North-Indian in his apartment, and fellow trainees at Citi. Bala, the boss, is proud of his loyalty, and expects the same from juniors. Being from IIMA, Krish is put straight into Priority Customer Banking, so that he can charm them with his degree, and ~~steal~~ invest their money. His primary tool are the reports from research team, composed of equally bored MBA grads. He commits the first ~~crime~~ deal with a rich housewife, who falls down 70% amid dot-com-burst. Anil, the country manager inspects the firm, and Bala pleads Krish to take the blame of the aggressive loss-making strategies. Grounding? Being North-Indian, IIT-IIM grad and a trainee. Some humiliation traded for lifetime service from boss, nice deal. On the other side, Ananya is busy with HLL work and meets Krish weekly or so. A fun incident is when she comes to Krish's apartment, greeted with chicken and beer, and then with the landlord of a society with non-veg, alcohol and now girls banned. Moving to the mission, Krish starts taking Manju's(Ananya's younger brother) JEE tuitions at **5 a.m.**. One down, two left. He does regular breakfast with the family, but the vibe doesnt match for a potential son-in-law. Meanwhile, Harish, an IIT-M and MIT-offered CISCO lad comes for rishta. The funny part, Krish is present in the whole meeting. Although Ananya has a final 'no', her mother is forever angry on this. Now, for the father, Krish teaches him ~~makes his~~ PPT, a rare skill for DGM of a govt. bank. They share drinks, and personal secrets. The PPT goes to Delhi, and becomes national inspiration. One more down, one left. For the mother, things go worse post plate-shop incident. The problem solver in Krish comes out, and he invites the mother to sing at a company event, sharing stage with Tamil stalwarts. Some context, Radha's Carnatic career is on a downfall post Chennai posting, and is a reason for her grief. This recognition could change everything. During event preparation, Krish and Ananya go to a day's trip to Pondicherry for both work and relax. Krish happens to meet a Guru, where his story with father is reveiled. Lesson: "Forgiveness is the key to ending pain induced by others.". With his own mother being sad at Delhi, he decided to wrap up Chennai asap. The event is a success and the Swaminathan's are all for Krish. Hooray! Now, the other half: Krish's parents have their turn. Takeaways: tradeoffs are important part of life, nothing can beat perseverance, and tackle problems part-by-part, they usually get solved, for example here, geniunely helping people to win their confidence.
