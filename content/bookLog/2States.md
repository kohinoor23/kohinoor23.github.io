### Act 1: Ahmedabad  
(_03/12/23_) Starts off with the first meet between Krish and Ananya . Ananya  is the college crush, and brimming with confidence. Krish turns a chance encounter into a restaurant lunch, by a sacrifice of a rasgulla. A weekly cycle broken for the sake of a lifelong commitment. Well done! At lunch, they dive deeper into lives, knowing about 11 martyrs before Ka. Krish is undettered, and they move closer via Microeconomics, Krish showcasing his math prowess. Silent study sessions slowly turn to acts of restraint for Ka, and it all comes together a few days after they fetch a B+ and A-. Now, the author happily fast forwards 1.5 years to placement season, where the question of "what next" comes up. Quite cinematic of how Krish interrupts Ananya 's interview to tell his final decision of "what next". In the end, all turns out well between them, and comes the next challenge: family. The first encounters are anticlimatic, and the act is curtained. Some key takeaways: Loved how Krish utilised his geeky math prowess to keep the connection, and used the "ignore strategy" to remind Ananya  of his importance. Also, he knew of the right time to report his uneasiness. 

## Act 2: Delhi
(_04/12/23_) Scene at Krish's Delhi home. He is yet to join Citibank, and is fully-free. The decision of choosing his first work location haunts him. A small fight with his mother and his father's attitude towards family convinces him to keep Delhi as a top choice. Ananya's memories help Chennai to battle Delhi for the top spot. An interesting detour is taken when Krish's mother takes him to see Dolly, a rich Punjabi girl. Turns out she knows about Krish and Ananya from family connections, and is still interested in Krish. Dolly is mocked by the author for her maturity in relationships. Krish has a straight 'no', and smartly uses his "writing ambition" to seal the deal. Some heated discussions with the post-military father are covered. In the end, Krish fills both Delhi and Chennai at top. As it turns out, God assigns him to Chennai. Some key takeaways: Secrets about personal life zoom through family, beware; even God supports true love.
