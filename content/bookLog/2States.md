### Act 1: Ahmedabad  
(_03/12/23_) Starts off with the first meet between Ka and An. An is the college crush, and brimming with confidence. Ka turns a chance encounter into a restaurant lunch, by a sacrifice of a rasgulla. A weekly cycle broken for the sake of a lifelong commitment. Well done! At lunch, they dive deeper into lives, knowing about 11 martyrs before Ka. Ka is undettered, and they move closer via Microeconomics, Ka showcasing his math prowess. Silent study sessions slowly turn to acts of restraint for Ka, and it all comes together a few days after they fetch a B+ and A-. Now, the author happily fast forwards 1.5 years to placement season, where the question of "what next" comes up. Quite cinematic of how Ka interrupts An's interview to tell his final decision of "what next". In the end, all turns out well between them, and comes the next challenge: family. The first encounters are anticlimatic, and the act is curtained. Some key takeaways: Loved how Ka utilised his geeky math prowess to keep the connection, and used the "ignore strategy" to remind An of his importance. Also, he knew of the right time to report his uneasiness.
